You cannot overfeed a breastfed baby, and your baby will not become spoiled or demanding if you feed them whenever they're hungry or need comfort.\nHow long should each breastfeed last?\nEvery baby is different. Some babies want frequent short feeds, and others prefer feeding for longer, or a mixture of both.

Mom and baby fitness classes are another great way to meet other moms and increase your confidence to engage in physical activity. Or perhaps you need some time without baby (that’s okay too!). Consider joining a sports league and take advantage of your teammates, family, and friends to help with childcare. You deserve time for yourself. Don’t be afraid to use your support system!\nNot quite ready for physical activity yet? That’s okay. Consider joining a mom’s group on social media. Even if you aren’t up for physical activity quite yet, having a community of mothers to support your journey through parenthood is vital in the early years and beyond.\nFinding your stride",

Here are a few evidence-informed strategies that can help you stay motivated and accountable to yourself, while also supporting your mental and physical health:\nStart small. Sometimes the hardest part is getting started. Your body has been through a lot, and you’re likely not starting at the same point that you were pre-baby. Even a short walk can make a world of difference for your physical and mental health. \nReflect on your values. Reflecting on your intentions around being physically active can help you better understand yourself.

Consider using the SMART acronym: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Time-oriented. For instance, a short-term SMART goal may be to do 10 push-ups once per day for the next 10 weeks. A long-term SMART goal may be to sign up and complete a 5k race at 1 year postpartum. Setting goals that are within your control are crucial. Women often set weight-related goals as they work toward shedding excess weight from pregnancy. However, there are a lot of additional factors, such as your hormones, that don’t necessarily allow you to be fully in control of your weight. We recommend setting goals that focus on health, wellbeing and enjoyment.\nMake it fun! Put enjoyment first and try not to get caught up in the numbers, like weight, time or distance.

But it is safest to continue to avoid some things:\nAvoid drinking alcohol: This is the safest approach, and it is especially important when your baby is very young. Their body is developing very fast and cannot process alcohol well. An occasional drink can be okay, as long as you plan for it. Breastfeed or express your milk before you have a drink, then wait at least 2 hours per drink before breastfeeding again.\nBe mindful of your caffeine intake: It is safe to have caffeine while breastfeeding, but only in small amounts. Too much caffeine and your baby may have trouble sleeping. Caffeine is found in coffee, tea (black, oolong, white and green), soft drinks (cola), energy drinks, chocolate, and herbs such as guarana and yerba mate. Keep your caffeine intake below 300 mg a day (two cups of coffee).",

Make sure breastfeeding is going well before you try to lose weight.

If your baby does not breastfeed well after you exercise, try breastfeeding before.

These muscles control the passage of urine and stool and support your baby during pregnancy. Pregnancy and childbirth can stretch and weaken these muscles. This can lead to urine control problems when you cough, laugh or exercise.\nPracticing Kegel exercises in the first few days after your baby is born may help improve your bladder control.

These are differences in their temperament. You may start noticing certain behaviours in your newborn soon after birth. How you respond to them will also help form their personality.

Most medical organizations and obstetricians recommend a vaginal delivery unless there is a medical reason for a C-section.\nVaginal delivery\nWhat is a vaginal delivery?\nIn a vaginal birth, your baby is born through your vagina or birth canal. It’s the most preferred and most common way to deliver a baby because it carries the lowest risk (in most cases). A vaginal delivery occurs most often between weeks 37 and 42 of pregnancy. A vaginal delivery has three stages: labor, birth and delivering the placenta.\nSome benefits of a vaginal delivery include:\nFaster recovery.\nSafest for you and your baby.\nLower rates of infection.\nBabies are at lower risk for respiratory problems and have a stronger immune system.\nLactation and breastfeeding are usually easier.\nA vaginal delivery can be spontaneous or induced:",

Your pregnancy care provider may recommend inducing labor if you have a medical condition or are past due. Labor is usually induced with Pitocin®, a synthetic form of the drug oxytocin.\nWhat happens if you don’t push during a vaginal delivery?\nIn most cases, once your cervix is fully dilated and your healthcare team is in place, your provider will ask you to push during a contraction. Pregnancy care providers have differing opinions on when to push, how long to push, delayed pushing or waiting until you feel the urge to push.",

Most often, the postpartum period is the first six to eight weeks after delivery, or until your body returns to its pre-pregnancy state. But the symptoms and changes that occur during the postpartum period can last far beyond eight weeks. Major body and life changes are happening at the same time during the postpartum period. Some changes are physical — for example, breast engorgement and vaginal bleeding. Other changes occur due to changing hormones. The bottom line is, giving birth is a major physical and emotional challenge. Being a caregiver and adjusting to life with an infant during the postpartum period is also incredibly demanding.",

Your breasts will produce milk, and even if you choose not to breastfeed, you’ll have painful and swollen breasts.\nPerineal soreness. It’s normal to have pain in the space between your vagina and anus (butthole) if you gave birth vaginally.

Your care will include things like your provider monitoring your blood pressure, heart rate and bleeding, and checking you for excess swelling.\nSubacute phase: This phase begins around 24 hours after birth and lasts for about two to six weeks. Your body is still changing, but you’re less likely to experience a medical emergency. Some of the concerns your provider may have during this period include cardiomyopathy, postpartum depression and symptoms related to urinary incontinence.",

Some of the most common physical symptoms in postpartum are:\nSoreness and pain in your perineum: Your perineum is the space between your vagina and anus.

The entire process can take up to six weeks, but it begins almost immediately after your baby is born. You can also expect to feel afterbirth pains (or strong cramps) while this happens. Most of the intense pains go away after a few days, but they can also feel more intense during breastfeeding.\nBreast engorgement and nipple pain: You can expect swollen and painful breasts for at least a few days or longer (if you breastfeed).

Some healthcare providers recommend stool softeners after you give birth to help. Hemorrhoids are also common in the postpartum period.\nC-section recovery: If you have stitches due to a C-section, your skin will take up to 10 days to heal.
